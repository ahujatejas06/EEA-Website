ACES
----

The Advanced Centre for Electronics Systems (ACES) was established in the early 1970s with a grant from the Ministry of Defence, Government of India. ACES was created to provide a platform for research and development related to electronics and defense. Its primary focus was developing new technologies and training the workforce for the defense sector. Over the years, ACES has become an integral part of our institution's Electrical Engineering (EE) department. The center houses most of the EE laboratories and facilities, and its expertise in electronics has contributed to the growth and development of the department.

Research & Development
----------------------

The department has been involved in several sponsored projects in many subject areas with sizeable interdisciplinary content. It is one of the largest R&D fund generators for IIT Kanpur, and faculty from EE is involved in setting up several large research facilities like a Real-Time Digital Simulator, Smart Grid, and 5G Test Bed. Faculty from EE has also been largely involved in setting up the Samtelcentre for display technologies and the National flexible electronics center. Several faculty in EE is also involved in industrial consultancy projects with private industrial giants like Qualcomm, LG India, Samsung India, and GE India, apart from state and central government agencies like BSNL, Power Grid Corporation, and CPRI.
